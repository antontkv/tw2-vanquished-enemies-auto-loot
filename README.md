# The Witcher 2: Vanquished Enemies AutoLoot

This mod adds combat auto loot. Only for ingredients, crafting components, and money. Which covers 95% of all loot from enemies, any other loot items are junk or quest items. A summary of all looted items will be shown after combat ends.

Also, any container with only herbs, crafting components, or money will be auto-looted.

### Installation

Copy CookedPC into the Witcher 2 install directory, overwriting existing files.

Since `base_scripts.dzip` is modified you need to merge script files if you use other mods that change this dzip. Use [Gibbed RED Tools With UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/1027) to unpack/pack `base_scripts.dzip` and programs like WinMerge to merge files.
